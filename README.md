## Project Overview

[Ten77 Dog Photography](http://example.com "Go to the Website") is a real business based in Teasside (Yourkshire, UK), where Nick, the sole proprietor, offers pet photography services. 
With Nick's blessing, I have decided to create a website for Ten77 Dog Photography to promote and increase awareness of his business. This project also acts as a platform to encourage people to get in touch with Nick both on formal and informal bases, which should lead to a higher customer turnover.



## UX 

With a wide variety of potential demographics + people of different backgrounds using the website, here are some examples of UX stories:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.




* prompting prospective clients to contanct Nick both on formal and informal basis 
* displaying his work in Gallery 
* promoting his social media outlets
* promoting his monthly offers
